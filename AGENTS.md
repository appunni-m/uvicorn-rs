Parent links group work; they do not gate readiness, but a parent cannot close with open children.
Use --blocks <dependent> / --blocked-by <prerequisite> only for real prerequisites; they gate kata ready.
Use --related <ref> for context only. kata wait observes state without requiring a dependency edge.

One writer per key: only write your own work.*. Ignore work.* on closed issues; never write it there.
Before stopping, close completed work or update both work.attention and work.attention_msg for the handoff.

Schedule/someday defer work; deadlines don’t. kata deadline <ref> <date-or-time> sets deadline_on without changing readiness.
Reached schedules and deadlines use notify.* for the current owner, or the author when unowned; clear with kata notify <ref> --to <recipient> --clear.
